You might need to specify a link to know more.\r\nPlease be sure what you provide is useful and meaningful enough, accordingly with the law expectations.\r\nJust as basic example, this is a generic element.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"cookies-monster\" class=\"hidden\">\r\n  This sites uses cookies. <a\r\n    class=\"cookies-monster-accepted\"\r\n    href=\"#cookies-monster\"\r\n  >Accept</a>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, the element should contain the class `hidden` plus eventually others.\r\n\r\n**Please note** that if an element with class `.cookies-monster-accepted` is present, this will be used to set the cookie once clicked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How To\r\n\r\nFollowing is the most basic layout you need. The script is not obtrusive and it can work within any layout already in production.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n    <link rel=\"styleSheet\"\r\n      href=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/cookies-monster/0.1.2/cookies-monster.css\">\r\n    <script async\r\n      src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/cookies-monster/0.1.2/cookies-monster.js\"></script>\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <div id=\"cookies-monster\" class=\"hidden\">\r\n      This sites uses cookies. <a\r\n        class=\"cookies-monster-accepted\"\r\n        href=\"#cookies-monster\"\r\n      >Accept</a>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see a [live working example here](http://webreflection.github.io/cookies-monster/test/test.html)\r\n\r\nFinally, a mandatory **special thanks to [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/)** for hosting this little js and css script.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThis project comes with a [WTFPL License](http://www.wtfpl.net/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\n\r\nThe script is compatible with every Mobile and Desktop browser.\r\nIf you want to support IE9 and/or eventually IE8 too, use these comments on top of your pages head.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!--[if lte IE 9]><style>label{display:block !important;}</style><script>(function(f){window.setTimeout=f(window.setTimeout);window.setInterval=f(window.setInterval)})(function(f){return function(c,t){var a=[].slice.call(arguments,2);return f(function(){c.apply(this,a)},t)}});</script><![endif]-->\r\n<!--[if IE 8]><script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ie8/0.2.5/ie8.js\"></script><![endif]-->\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that you can include the script either deferred or async or however you like.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
