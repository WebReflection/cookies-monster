{"name":"Cookies-monster","tagline":"The pointless EU law simplified","body":"cookies-monster\r\n===============\r\n\r\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/WebReflection/cookies-monster.png)](http://travis-ci.org/WebReflection/cookies-monster)\r\n\r\n# Simplified HTML, CSS and JS for every taste.\r\n\r\n### The JS part\r\nWhenever a user scrolls, or click `Accept`, the banner disappears for a year and for the whole domain.\r\n\r\nThe script is compatible with every Mobile and Desktop browser.\r\nOnly caveat is: if you want to support IE9 and eventually IE8 too, use this comment on top of your page header.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!--[if lte IE 9]><style>label{display:block !important;}</style><script>(function(f){window.setTimeout=f(window.setTimeout);window.setInterval=f(window.setInterval)})(function(f){return function(c,t){var a=[].slice.call(arguments,2);return f(function(){c.apply(this,a)},t)}});</script><![endif]-->\r\n<!--[if IE 8]><script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ie8/0.2.5/ie8.js\"></script><![endif]-->\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that you can include the script either deferred or async or however you like.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The CSS part\r\nThe [current file](src/cookies-monster.css) includes an  image, but it doesn't have to. It's just an example of what the script expect.\r\n\r\nBe sure you have defined both `#cookies-monster` and `#cookies-monster.hidden` behaviors, and feel free to style its optional link element which by default should have  a `.cookies-monster-accepted` class.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The HTML part\r\nIt can be anything you want, as long as the container id is `cookies-monster`. You might need to specify a link to know more: it's up to you and I am not responsible for anything wrong you could write in the element. Just as basic example, this is a generic element.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"cookies-monster\" class=\"hidden\">\r\n  This sites uses cookies. <a\r\n    class=\"cookies-monster-accepted\"\r\n    href=\"#cookies-monster\"\r\n  >Accept</a>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, the element should contain the class `hidden` plus eventually others.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
